# Car-Price-Pred-Notebook
Work on the kaggle dataset in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/car-price-prediction-challenge?select=car_price_prediction.csv

# What I have learned:
- Clean data: handling missing values, wrong data type.
- Perform Elementary Data Analysis: exploring data and relationships by different types of graph.
- Used a predicting model to predict car prices: using Linear Regression and its metric.
- Prepared data for Linear Regression Model: doing simple feature engineering.a
